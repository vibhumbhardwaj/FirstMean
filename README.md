Wow. It's been a month already.
1. Upvoting isn't done yet. so many issues saving the data. *check for NaN in points' value*
2. Changed frontend contract for toggleUpvote, only book id required in request, not the whole object.


05-06:
1. Dynamic link is **GREEN**, but no handling is there yet.
2. Points 2,3,4 are still remaining.
<eom>


04-06:

Upvote is Green now! Yellow actually.
**TODO**--> 
 1. Dynamic links for books.
 2. Proper Contract b/w front-back end.
 3. Implementing that upvote thing.
 4. Issuing the book.


02-06: 

1. JWT Verification is a go now!!!
2. mapping b/w books and users is now more clear.
3. TODO>:>>> change in model: upvoted_by_user
4. also, check if separate upvoted by and downvoted by are required or simple books he voted structure is good **ANALYSIS REQUIRED**.
